# Week 3 - NEXTJS and TAILWINDCSS

## Create Next App

### Tasks Performed

1. Installed Next.js in my local system using `npm create-next-app@latest`.
2. Initialized Next.js in JavaScript with Tailwind CSS and ESLint.
3. Understood the folder structure of Next.js.

---

### New Learnings

- Next.js routing is done through folders — folder name becomes route name.  
  Example: `/Dashboard/page.js` becomes `https://xyz.com/dashboard`.

- For nested routing, nested directories are used.  
  Example: `/Product/Reviews` becomes `https://xyz.com/products/reviews`.

- Got introduced to:
  - Client Components
  - Server Components

- Learned about:
  - Image and Text Optimization using `Image` and `Link` components.
  - Server Side Rendering (SSR)
  - Static Site Generation (SSG)
